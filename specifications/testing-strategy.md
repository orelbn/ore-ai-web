# Testing Strategy

## Goals
- Keep feedback loops fast during development.
- Catch regressions before merge and before deployment.
- Start lean and increase rigor as product complexity grows.

---

## Test Levels

| Level | Scope | Tooling | When to run |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Unit | Pure functions, utilities, data transforms | Bun test runner (`bun test`) | Local development + CI |
| Integration | Route handlers, server actions, component integration points | Bun test runner (`bun test`) | Local development + CI |
| Evals | Prompt behavior sanity checks against the real model | Node test runner (`bun run evals`) | Local development |
| End-to-End | Critical user journeys across app routes | TBD | CI (required before production release) |

---

## Repository Conventions
- Place tests next to implementation files when practical using `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`.
- For TanStack file-routed pages, route-level tests can live in `src/app`; route generation ignores `*.test.ts(x)` via `routeFileIgnorePattern`.
- Keep tests deterministic when practical (evals intentionally call the real model).
- Prefer testing behavior and outcomes over implementation details.
- Expand eval coverage incrementally from the single baseline eval as prompt quality work grows.

## Current Coverage (February 2026)
- Route protection tests in `src/app/route-protection.test.ts`.
- API route behavior tests in:
  - `src/app/api/chat.test.ts`
  - `src/app/api/chats.test.ts`
  - `src/app/api/auth/$.test.ts`
- Core chat domain tests in:
  - `src/lib/chat/assistant-stream.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/chat/repository.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/chat/validation.test.ts`
- Workspace utility tests in `src/components/agent-workspace/workspace-utils.test.ts`.
- Prompt eval test in:
  - `evals/model-eval.ts`

---

## CI Quality Gates
- Run on every pull request and on `main`.
- Required checks:
  - Type checking
  - Linting
  - Unit/Integration tests
  - Build verification

---

## Evolution Plan
- Phase 1: Establish stable unit and integration coverage for core logic.
- Phase 2: Add baseline evals for high-impact prompts, tools, and safety constraints.
- Phase 3: Add end-to-end coverage for top critical flows.
- Phase 4: Add explicit coverage and eval pass-rate thresholds once baseline suites are stable.
